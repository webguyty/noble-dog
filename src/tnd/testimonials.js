      "Tyler is amazing! His expertise has made a difficult situation into a success story. I rescued a 14 month-old JRT mix.  She had fear, anxiety & was aggressive towards people & dogs. Tyler helped give me the tools to help her become relaxed & happy. She's no longer aggressive & has become friendly. We are able to go to the dog park & she's now able to feel secure & comfortable. Our 3 pack is now much more harmonious!",

      "The Noble dog worked with our dog Jaygo. He is a tough one to work with because he is so smart and VERY STUBBORN! Tyler did it with ease and was so knowledgeable!!! I love how personable he is and I can text him any time I have questions about training now! Thank you for helping make our dog Jaygo better to be around! He listens to our commands WAY better, he walks side by side on a leash. This is HUGE!!! He used to yank us so hard and now he's perfect! I highly recommend!",

      "We are so glad we found Tyler. He was the perfect mix to ease our dog's anxiety when we left the house. He didn't just train our dog - he trained us on the techniques to train Franklin. While our problem wasn't walking our dog, it was interesting to learn helpful skills to show Franklin who is boss, while out on a walk. I appreciated Tyler's flexibility, professionalism, out of the box training methods, and incredible dog training skills. We have one happy dog, and we are glad we can leave the house without a barking, anxiety filled dog.",

      "My new rescue, Luna is a small terrier mix who is such a sweet dog... with people. I noticed she would lunge, snarl, and yelp loudly at other dogs she saw. When my family visited and brought their puppy, she would snap at him, and even charged at him when he got too close to me or her toys. She made a scene literally everywhere I took her, and it was horribly embarrassing. I did not want to take her anywhere for fear of her causing trouble with  another dog. After her evaluation with Tyler, we spent her first session at the dog park (Personally, I was terrified anticipating how the session would go). Tyler started by helping her to learn to walk by other dogs without yelping and aggressively charging towards them. After a bit, we slowly made our way into the park. He worked with me to teach me how to handle her outbursts, and it was incredibly effective. She responded almost immediately. We have had four sessions with him and have been attending the social meetups he holds every few weeks (a great perk of utilizing his services), and she has been great, with no serious incidents since beginning training. She's even become BFF with my family's dog! I always joke with Tyler that Luna responded too quickly to his training, and he never got to see her in her full insane glory. In reality though, I'm grateful she responded so quickly. We will continue going to Tyler's social meet ups and utilizing his tips and tricks. He even tolerates my incessant dog related questions via text! 10/10 would highly recommend.",

      "Working with The Noble Dog was a great experience for my husband and I.  We have a black lab that was experiencing aggression issues after being attacked by stray dogs on a run.  We went from taking him with us everywhere to avoiding taking him on walks because if he saw another dog a block away he freaked out.  We realized this was unhealthy for both our dog and us and on recommendation from many of our friends called up Tyler for our free consultation.  After that first meeting, our dog immediately showed improvement so we signed up for six sessions with Tyler. It was such a great experience!  Tyler has this amazing ability to read both dog and owner to figure out exactly what problems need to be addressed.  During our final two lessons we were able to walk our dog along the Ventura Pier through a festival with tons of other dogs on leashes all around us and in close proximity.  We now feel confident taking our dog with us to public places and allowing him to meet other dogs. We would recommend Tyler to anyone looking for dog training.  As a puppy we took our dog to a big chain's puppy training and didn't really feel like we learned more than what we could teach him at home.  It's a totally different experience with Tyler who comes into your home and provides very specific guidance tailored to you and your dog's needs.  The Noble Dog is an excellent value. We learned so much and are so pleased!",

      "Our 9 months old German Shepherd named Turbo was having aggression both towards people and other dogs.  He would go berserk on walks when he sees other people or dogs.  He would bark and lunges aggressively toward them.  The issues seems to be getting worse and worse, to the point where we were contemplating on giving him up, but we decided to give him another chance.  We found out about Tyler from The Noble Dog and decided to enlist Turbo for the training.  We had six training sessions with Tyler.  After a few sessions Turbo's behavior had improved 70%-80%.  We were able to handle him properly on walks using the techniques Tyler taught.  Turbo's behavior improved dramatically as the sessions went on.  After six sessions we were able to walk turbo around parks where there are lots of people and other dogs.  Turbo was also able to walk along with other dogs.  We are really happy and grateful for the training Tyler provided.  Turbo no longer have aggression issues and it is so enjoyable taking him on walks.  Tyler is a great dog trainer and we highly recommend him.",

      "We got our rescue dog Odie, a rescue who is about 1 year old, and we slowly found out he didn't like men, and most likely experienced some level of abuse before we got him.  He was aggressive towards men, not well mannered when walking, and was beginning to try to take things over in the house. In comes Tyler...he quickly and calmly figures out the first few areas of focus, which is mostly on how we interact and manage the dog and things got better almost instantly.  Tyler said we'd need 3 sessions...I thought he was crazy, I was thinking more like 10, but he was right. I'm happy to say that with 3 sessions our dog went from being almost unbearable to a perfect fit in our home.  Tonight he even jumped up into my lap to hang out with me, that is an amazing change from a few weeks ago.",

      "I've always had Bigger (Huge) dogs, usually two to three at a time. Currently, I have a dominate Saint Bernard that just doesn't like anyone or other dogs, except those he lives with. He'll bark at everything he sees, lunge at anything that enters his comfort zone (10 to 15 feet of him on a good day) and let someone come up from behind, Holy S-- the fun begins.. I've tried doing what worked with my other dogs, watching the videos on dog behaviors with him, had other \"Trainers\" Everything helped a little, but Nothing \"Fixed\" All His Issues. At my whit's end I contacted Tyler, explained my situation and he didn't balk, told me he felt he could help me with my situation. Our first two sessions Tyler could not get within 12 feet of my dog without him going all agro. I was starting to wonder if he would stay around with all the loving he was gettin. Fun times for all. By the end of our third session there were significant improvements and at six weeks I was feeling comfortable being in a crowd and able to walk him thru. With a little direction and going against what has become the \"Norm\" in the dog training world, he has proven he knows what he is doing and that will get the results you not only Want but Need. I can now take my dog out in public. People actually like to see him out and about instead of running and hiding. Should you need help with your problem pooch? I can only suggest that you try The Noble Dog first. Wish I had. Would have saved me months of grief and frustration. Remember, He Trains You to Deal With Your Dog. While Fixing Your Dog from all your Mistakes you had no idea you were making, your results are probably not going to be instantaneous but always worth the time and effort invested. The monthly meet-ups are great way to find out your not the only one with a problem pooch and you get to meet others going thru the process while seeing the progress you're making and testing how your pooch is doing without people judging you. Remember.. RELAX and Have Fun",

      "Tyler made a great first impression. Immediately, I could tell that he loved animals and had a strong passion for his work.  I have a Boxer/Lab that had some highly undesirable habits ( Ok.  This dog was nuts). Within the first ten minutes It became apparent that Tyler had far superior levels of patience than any human should. It's been four weeks now and  I sometimes think somebody traded out my dog with a well behaved stunt double. All joking aside, I couldn't  recommend a better choice for dog training than The Noble Dog.",

      'Tyler knows dogs really well. I have adopted a small poodle from the animal shelter few months ago. His name is Boo! Boo is super sweet dog. Hardly ever barks, quiet , behave well, and  no issues at home. I took him to a dog park soon after I adopted him thinking he will have a great time! Well....... unfortunately ,I was WRONG! He is only 12lb, however, I had discovered that he had such a bad aggression issues with other dogs! Since he is so quiet, when he decide to attack other dogs, there was no symptoms, he would  just all a sudden attacked other dogs regardless of the size of other dogs. My friend calls him "A stick of a dynamite". Anyhow, I found Tyler as a local dog trainer and I did not hesitate to sign up. I had 3 sessions and he confidently trained me how I supposed to be the leader to my dog by demonstrating how to walk Boo, what leash to use, and how I must behave towards other dog so that Boo would know I am the boss. All I can say is thank you Tyler and now Boo\'s aggression is much more calm, and most importantly I became a better parent. Do you walk your dog or your dog is walking you? If your dog is walking you, you need to contact Tyler asap!',

He would even notice before Bentley did some times. We have been seeing Tyler for a couple months now. He is always very flexible with our busy schedules and has even came to our house to help lay down some very needed ground rules. Bentley still protects my girls, but now he does it without aggression. We can't thank him enough for the time he has put into helping us.",

Tyler is just awesome! He is very professional and nice. He showed us techniques with training our dog. The training tips Tyler gave us are so helpful and we've noticed a huge change in Cody's behavior. Cody is a small rat terrier mix and thinks he's some tough little guy with wanting to be alpha male around other dogs. He is now actually wanting to play with other dogs. Tyler also showed us how to walk Cody off the leash, something I thought my dog would never do! I highly recommend Tyler",

She has some past trauma and appeared to have little to no prior dog interaction. She is very tough and appears more pit bull-like. Over time she has shown more and more aggression towards other dogs in the neighborhood. We've struggled through a few trainers to help us. Tyler did more in the first session than anyone else had for her. He has experience with aggressive and stubborn dogs and great ideas to help us. He helped us give her the structure and mental stimulation she needed and tools on how to handle dog interactions outside. His free weekend meet-up sessions with other dogs were really helpful! His prices are reasonable and I am impressed with how much we accomplished in just 3 sessions.",

      "Our three year old female Shiba Inu, Lilo, was becoming increasingly defiant and aggressive.  She would growl at us whenever we made her do anything she didn't want to.  She displayed dominant behavior toward my wife, food aggression and general disobedience.  We went to training class offered through Petco and were told her aggression was the result of bad breeding and there was nothing they could do!  We tried techniques that we saw on Cesar Millan TV programs and read in dog training books to no avail.  Obviously we were doing something wrong. We researched local dog trainers, and hired Tyler based on the positive Yelp reviews from his clients.  Tyler showed us that Lilo just needed to have someone take over the leadership position in the pack from her.  Tyler taught us how to properly walk Lilo; not allowing her to lead the walk but to follow alongside without pulling or jerking.  Just this one action dramatically reduced a lot of her previously misconduct.  Tyler also showed us how to confront Lilo's obstinate behavior by firmly standing our ground and calmly insisting on the action we wanted from her.  Our training sessions were conducted both at our home and at parks and dog parks. After completing a six session training regiment with Tyler, we are confident that we have conquered all our major problems with Lilo and through consistent follow-thru of the techniques we have learned that both Lilo's and our lives will be anxiety free. We highly recommend Tyler for anybody needing guidance in correcting canine problems and establishing good behavior disciplines with their dogs.",

Riley was a bit of handful (barking, biting, separation anxiety, dominance) but he is definitely showing improvement in practically everything we've worked on with Tyler.  He also helped us understand how we should be acting around him to make sure Riley knew he wasn't in charge.  He still thinks he's in charge sometimes, but now its much more manageable!  We blasted through the entire puppy package of 8 sessions and went back for an extra one just to be sure - Tyler was calm, patient, and excellent with Riley.  The pricing was very reasonable as well.  We even went to the sessions with the other dogs and my tiny little puppy decided he liked to be friends with all the big dogs!

Our dog was always very scared, nervous, anxious, and on top of that just plain stubborn and we couldn't take her out in public because she would just start acting all crazy on the leash and it got to a point where we just got frustrated and didn't know what to do. So Tyler came in with a free assessment and was able to help our Shiba overcome her fears and anxieties in public with a couple of classes. He also helped us to become better dog parents as well since we were reinforcing bad behavior, which he pointed out.  He knows what he is talking about, taught us how to properly communicate with our dog, and now we can take our dog everywhere with us!

      'First off, we want to thank Tyler for accepting our puppy at a very young age (2 months) for the dog training. The reason we wanted to train her  so early is because since she is a husky and also VERY stubborn, so we wanted to have her on the right path from the very beginning. The first session we had Milky was acting very awful. We started off walking her next to us and she was screaming and barking for like 45mins. She was pulling the leash and trying so hard to just lay on the ground. But Tyler was calm and patient with her, that shows me that it is a very important element in teaching your pet. So over the next few weeks, we followed the homework Tyler gave out and did the same to her, now she always walks next to us and not pulling on leash, also when she seems to speed up a bit and i say "slow down" she actually knows and does it. Some other issues such as biting and barking were also improved A LOT! I could never believe she could turn out to be more than i expected. Also, Tyler has Dog meetings every 2 weeks to have all the dogs socialize which i think is a great method! I highly recommend Tyler!',
