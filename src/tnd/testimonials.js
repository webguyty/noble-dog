      "Tyler is amazing! His expertise has made a difficult situation into a success story. I rescued a 14 month-old JRT mix.  She had fear, anxiety & was aggressive towards people & dogs. Tyler helped give me the tools to help her become relaxed & happy. She's no longer aggressive & has become friendly. We are able to go to the dog park & she's now able to feel secure & comfortable. Our 3 pack is now much more harmonious!",

      "The Noble dog worked with our dog Jaygo. He is a tough one to work with because he is so smart and VERY STUBBORN! Tyler did it with ease and was so knowledgeable!!! I love how personable he is and I can text him any time I have questions about training now! Thank you for helping make our dog Jaygo better to be around! He listens to our commands WAY better, he walks side by side on a leash. This is HUGE!!! He used to yank us so hard and now he's perfect! I highly recommend!",

      "We are so glad we found Tyler. He was the perfect mix to ease our dog's anxiety when we left the house. He didn't just train our dog - he trained us on the techniques to train Franklin. While our problem wasn't walking our dog, it was interesting to learn helpful skills to show Franklin who is boss, while out on a walk. I appreciated Tyler's flexibility, professionalism, out of the box training methods, and incredible dog training skills. We have one happy dog, and we are glad we can leave the house without a barking, anxiety filled dog.",

      "My new rescue, Luna is a small terrier mix who is such a sweet dog... with people. I noticed she would lunge, snarl, and yelp loudly at other dogs she saw. When my family visited and brought their puppy, she would snap at him, and even charged at him when he got too close to me or her toys. She made a scene literally everywhere I took her, and it was horribly embarrassing. I did not want to take her anywhere for fear of her causing trouble with  another dog. After her evaluation with Tyler, we spent her first session at the dog park (Personally, I was terrified anticipating how the session would go). Tyler started by helping her to learn to walk by other dogs without yelping and aggressively charging towards them. After a bit, we slowly made our way into the park. He worked with me to teach me how to handle her outbursts, and it was incredibly effective. She responded almost immediately. We have had four sessions with him and have been attending the social meetups he holds every few weeks (a great perk of utilizing his services), and she has been great, with no serious incidents since beginning training. She's even become BFF with my family's dog! I always joke with Tyler that Luna responded too quickly to his training, and he never got to see her in her full insane glory. In reality though, I'm grateful she responded so quickly. We will continue going to Tyler's social meet ups and utilizing his tips and tricks. He even tolerates my incessant dog related questions via text! 10/10 would highly recommend.",

      "Working with The Noble Dog was a great experience for my husband and I.  We have a black lab that was experiencing aggression issues after being attacked by stray dogs on a run.  We went from taking him with us everywhere to avoiding taking him on walks because if he saw another dog a block away he freaked out.  We realized this was unhealthy for both our dog and us and on recommendation from many of our friends called up Tyler for our free consultation.  After that first meeting, our dog immediately showed improvement so we signed up for six sessions with Tyler. It was such a great experience!  Tyler has this amazing ability to read both dog and owner to figure out exactly what problems need to be addressed.  During our final two lessons we were able to walk our dog along the Ventura Pier through a festival with tons of other dogs on leashes all around us and in close proximity.  We now feel confident taking our dog with us to public places and allowing him to meet other dogs. We would recommend Tyler to anyone looking for dog training.  As a puppy we took our dog to a big chain's puppy training and didn't really feel like we learned more than what we could teach him at home.  It's a totally different experience with Tyler who comes into your home and provides very specific guidance tailored to you and your dog's needs.  The Noble Dog is an excellent value. We learned so much and are so pleased!",

      "Our 9 months old German Shepherd named Turbo was having aggression both towards people and other dogs.  He would go berserk on walks when he sees other people or dogs.  He would bark and lunges aggressively toward them.  The issues seems to be getting worse and worse, to the point where we were contemplating on giving him up, but we decided to give him another chance.  We found out about Tyler from The Noble Dog and decided to enlist Turbo for the training.  We had six training sessions with Tyler.  After a few sessions Turbo's behavior had improved 70%-80%.  We were able to handle him properly on walks using the techniques Tyler taught.  Turbo's behavior improved dramatically as the sessions went on.  After six sessions we were able to walk turbo around parks where there are lots of people and other dogs.  Turbo was also able to walk along with other dogs.  We are really happy and grateful for the training Tyler provided.  Turbo no longer have aggression issues and it is so enjoyable taking him on walks.  Tyler is a great dog trainer and we highly recommend him.",

      "We got our rescue dog Odie, a rescue who is about 1 year old, and we slowly found out he didn't like men, and most likely experienced some level of abuse before we got him.  He was aggressive towards men, not well mannered when walking, and was beginning to try to take things over in the house. In comes Tyler...he quickly and calmly figures out the first few areas of focus, which is mostly on how we interact and manage the dog and things got better almost instantly.  Tyler said we'd need 3 sessions...I thought he was crazy, I was thinking more like 10, but he was right. I'm happy to say that with 3 sessions our dog went from being almost unbearable to a perfect fit in our home.  Tonight he even jumped up into my lap to hang out with me, that is an amazing change from a few weeks ago.",
