            Don't blame yourself or your dog! Behavior issues are VERY common.
            They are often a result of conditioning, genetics, separation
            anxiety, and several other factors.

          <p>
            In every dog, there's one that's loving and able to behave well in
            any setting. My goal with “The Noble Dog” is to help bring out that
            part of the dog's personality, and let it dominate. There is simply
            no need to put up with, or otherwise tolerate, poor/unwanted
            behavior from your dog.
          </p>

            <strong>Do you feel like your dog runs the house? </strong>
          </p>
          <p className='text-center'>
            <strong>
              Do you often feel like your dog is “in control” instead of you?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p className='text-center'>
            <strong>It's time to take back control NOW.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            I specialize in teaching both you as well as your dog how to
            coexist, with the proper order and hierarchy. An important (and
            often-missed) part of training is involvement, and yes, training the
            owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through my proven methods, I'll teach you how to be an effective,
            loving leader for your dog.
          </p>
          <p>
            In no time at all, we will have your dog treating you and your home
            with respect and proper behavior. It's a matter of patience,
            conditioning, and a positive training environment.

            Whether your dog's particular issue shows up on this list or not, I
            can help! Beyond that, I'll ensure that you end up with a dog who
            will also obey simple commands too!
          </p>
          <p>
            While I specialize in discipline and behavior issues rather than
            “obedience” training, I can work with your pet to obey any set of
            commands you desire. All it takes is time and patience.

          <h3>So What Training Methods Do I Use?</h3>
          <p>
            I believe in utilizing training methods that are positive, simple
            and effective. They must be able to apply to different aspects of a
            dog and owner's relationship. We set out to achieve a goal. That
            goal is to establish you, the owner as a good, respected leader for
            your dog. It's important to establish that the dog will respect you
            as its leader in the correct manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            This in turn motivates the dog to naturally want to obey commands,
            as well as make an effort to please his leader, you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, dogs are naturally “pack animals”. It's in their DNA. One
            dog becomes the effective leader, and all the other members of the
            pack follow and obey the leader. The ultimate goal is to establish
            you as an effective and respected “leader” for your dog. As a
            result, he will naturally want to listen to you, as well as try his
            hardest to please you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Believe it or not, a huge part of what I do is train the human side
            of the dog-owner equation to become truly effective leaders.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the sessions are “hands-on”. We will also discuss the theory
            of dog behavior in detail along the way. I will work with you as
            well as your dog in order to establish proper technique and
            communication. Every dog is different, so we'll also take the time
            to learn about your dog's own psychology and behavior patterns.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Remember that accomplishing this successfully, takes time and
            commitment.{' '}

          <p className='text-center'>
            <u>
              Here are the more common problems that most dog owners experience
              with their pets:
            </u>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The importance of fulfilling your dog's needs</li>
            <li>Proper walking and discipline procedures</li>
            <li>
              Effectively setting rules of the household for your dog to abide
              by, with no tolerance of bad behavior
            </li>
            <li>And much more!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I find using a balanced approach to be the best way to set the
            foundation. This means using both positive reinforcement, as well as
            proper correction techniques. In my experience, this approach is the
            fastest and most effective way to stop bad behavior. It's also the
            best way to influence new and proper behavior in the future.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the more established ways of using positive reinforcement
            that most trainers use is by giving treats. I for one, do NOT do
            this. Instead, I prefer to use positive reinforcement in regards to
            what the dog wants. And believe it or not, that is very rarely
            treats. Your dog wants your love and attention more than treats.{' '}
          </p>
          <h3>Here's an example</h3>
          <p>
            I will often ask a dog I work with to sit and stay before exiting
            the house. If the dog successfully obeys, he will be positively
            rewarded by being taken outside for a walk. The dog is able to make
            the connection between obeying and direct positive rewards in a very
            logical way. This approach allows you as an owner to essentially
            train and adjust your dog's behavior through the course of a day.
            Without the use of repetitive, non-changing rewards, such as treats.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            When I use a correction action, the goal is to simply snap the dog
            out of its current mindset. A correction can be anything from a
            specific noise (as in saying "no"), or a calm-but-assertive touch.
            The point of doing this is to let the dog know that he needs to be
            focusing on what I want him to be focusing on at that particular
            time.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not believe it's ever proper to use a correction to hit or hurt
            a dog, or cause any kind of discomfort even remotely. It's important
            as a trainer to remain calm with the dog he's working with. This
            encourages the dog to trust and remain calm right back with the
            trainer (as well as with you!).{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, I handle every dog with the same degree of love and
            attention I do with my very own. As ANY good trainer should.
          </p>
          <h3>What tools do I use?</h3>
          <p>
            To me, the most powerful tool, at the risk of sounding cliché', is
            the mind. When you learn the proper way to ask your dog to obey a
            command, you will learn more than just that. You will also learn the
            proper voice tone and body language to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            These elements go a long way in establishing the leadership role. It
            clearly communicates to the dog that YOU are the leader and shall be
            obeyed. Better yet, it will make the dog WANT to obey you. This is
            half the battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for “physical” tools, we will use whatever you as the owner are
            comfortable with. My standard tool is a slip lead. Nothing fancy or
            elaborate, but it works virtually every time. When we do the initial
            evaluation, we can discuss other tools. Including any you may be
            currently using with your dog, or have used in the past.
          </p>
          <h3>What can you expect?</h3>
          <p>
            As a result of my working with your dog, you can expect some very
            clear, distinct results:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Your dog will have excellent behavior skills, and will listen to
              your standard commands.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your dog will keep his or her personality, and the quirky
              characteristics you have come to love.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your dog will live within the rules you have established, and will
              be happy to do it.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>How long will it take?</h3>
          <p>
            This depends greatly on a few factors. It also depends on what
            you're willing to commit on a personal level towards the training
            and rehabilitation of your dog. It's important to understand that
            effective training, behavior modification, and rehabilitation all
            take time. Also, just as importantly, it requires consistency on
            your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you hire me to work with your dog, be assured that you will get
            100% commitment from me towards you and your dog. All I ask is that
            you do the same. If you do, chances are very good that you will
            start seeing small changes almost immediately. Those changes will
            build on top of the previous changes with every day and every
            session.
          </p>
          <p>
            Commit to the process, and you will be amazed not only at the
            results, but how fast they will come along. Don't worry, I will
            commit to the process too. I will take on any case no matter how
            hopeless it may appear!
          </p>
          <p>
            As first a dog walker, then a trainer, I have dealt with dogs of all
            kinds of temperaments and dispositions. I even worked with a dog
            that was so aggressive towards humans, that he charged me the first
            time we made eye contact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within one week, he became completely calm-submissive, and safe to
            keep around. With only one hour's session, and giving the owner the
            proper procedures to manage the dog, they saw results in a WEEK.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was not just because of my work, but it was the owner's
            commitment that made all the difference. It's proof that with proper
            information, practice and consistency, any dog owner can achieve
            great results with ANY dog.
          </p>
          <h3>What will I have to do as the owner?</h3>
          <p>
            Remember, when you hire me, my job will be to train YOU as well as
            your dog. This process is easier than you think. It doesn't require
            hard work nearly as much as it requires consistency, and commitment.
            After each session, I will give you the homework for the week. For
            best and fastest results, commit to one hour a day to work with your
            dog to apply your homework.
          </p>
          <p>
            And no, “working” with your dog does not include petting your dog,
            or being in the same room with him. Just follow the simple steps I
            give you, do the homework, and you will see results in no time at
            all!
