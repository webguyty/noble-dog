They must be able to apply to different aspects of a\n            dog and owner's relationship. We set out to achieve a goal. That\n            goal is to establish you, the owner as a good, respected leader for\n            your dog. It's important to establish that the dog will respect you\n            as its leader in the correct manner.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This in turn motivates the dog to naturally want to obey commands,\n            as well as make an effort to please his leader, you.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Remember, dogs are naturally “pack animals”. It's in their DNA. One\n            dog becomes the effective leader, and all the other members of the\n            pack follow and obey the leader. The ultimate goal is to establish\n            you as an effective and respected “leader” for your dog. As a\n            result, he will naturally want to listen to you, as well as try his\n            hardest to please you.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Believe it or not, a huge part of what I do is train the human side\n            of the dog-owner equation to become truly effective leaders.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            All of the sessions are “hands-on”. We will also discuss the theory\n            of dog behavior in detail along the way. I will work with you as\n            well as your dog in order to establish proper technique and\n            communication. Every dog is different, so we'll also take the time\n            to learn about your dog's own psychology and behavior patterns.\n          </p>\n          <h3 id='trainingSuccess'>\n            Remember that accomplishing this successfully, takes time and\n            commitment.\n          </h3>\n          <h4>\n            <u>\n              <strong>\n                Here are the more common problems that most dog owners\n                experience with their pets:\n              </strong>\n            </u>\n          </h4>\n          <ul>\n            <li>The importance of fulfilling your dog's needs</li>\n            <li>Proper walking and discipline procedures</li>\n            <li>\n              Effectively setting rules of the household for your dog to abide\n              by, with no tolerance of bad behavior\n            </li>\n            <li>And much more!</li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>\n            I find using a balanced approach to be the best way to set the\n            foundation. This means using both positive reinforcement, as well as\n            proper correction techniques. In my experience, this approach is the\n            fastest and most effective way to stop bad behavior. It's also the\n            best way to influence new and proper behavior in the future.{' '}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            One of the more established ways of using positive reinforcement\n            that most trainers use is by giving treats. I for one, do NOT do\n            this. Instead, I prefer to use positive reinforcement in regards to\n            what the dog wants. And believe it or not, that is very rarely\n            treats. Your dog wants your love and attention more than treats.{' '}\n          </p>\n          <h3 id='trainingExample'>Here's an example</h3>\n          <p>\n            I will often ask a dog I work with to sit and stay before exiting\n            the house. If the dog successfully obeys, he will be positively\n            rewarded by being taken outside for a walk. The dog is able to make\n            the connection between obeying and direct positive rewards in a very\n            logical way. This approach allows you as an owner to essentially\n            train and adjust your dog's behavior through the course of a day.\n            Without the use of repetitive, non-changing rewards, such as treats.{' '}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When I use a correction action, the goal is to simply snap the dog\n            out of its current mindset. A correction can be anything from a\n            specific noise (as in saying \"no\"), or a calm-but-assertive touch.\n            The point of doing this is to let the dog know that he needs to be\n            focusing on what I want him to be focusing on at that particular\n            time.{' '}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I do not believe it's ever proper to use a correction to hit or hurt\n            a dog, or cause any kind of discomfort even remotely. It's important\n            as a trainer to remain calm with the dog he's working with. This\n            encourages the dog to trust and remain calm right back with the\n            trainer (as well as with you!).{' '}\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Remember, I handle every dog with the same degree of love and\n            attention I do with my very own. As ANY good trainer should.\n          </p>\n          <h3 id='trainingTools'>What tools do I use?</h3>\n          <p>\n            To me, the most powerful tool, at the risk of sounding cliché', is\n            the mind. When you learn the proper way to ask your dog to obey a\n            command, you will learn more than just that. You will also learn the\n            proper voice tone and body language to use.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            These elements go a long way in establishing the leadership role. It\n            clearly communicates to the dog that YOU are the leader and shall be\n            obeyed. Better yet, it will make the dog WANT to obey you. This is\n            half the battle.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As for “physical” tools, we will use whatever you as the owner are\n            comfortable with. My standard tool is a slip lead. Nothing fancy or\n            elaborate, but it works virtually every time. When we do the initial\n            evaluation, we can discuss other tools. Including any you may be\n            currently using with your dog, or have used in the past.\n          </p>\n          <h3 className='pb-3' id='trainingExpectations'>\n            What can you expect?\n          </h3>\n          <h4 className='pb-2'>\n            <strong>\n              <u>\n                As a result of my working with your dog, you can expect some\n                very clear, distinct results:\n              </u>\n            </strong>\n          </h4>\n          <ol>\n            <li>\n              Your dog will have excellent behavior skills, and will listen to\n              your standard commands.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Your dog will keep his or her personality, and the quirky\n              characteristics you have come to love.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Your dog will live within the rules you have established, and will\n              be happy to do it.\n            </li>\n          </ol>\n          <h3 id='trainingLength'>How long will it take?</h3>\n          <p>\n            This depends greatly on a few factors. It also depends on what\n            you're willing to commit on a personal level towards the training\n            and rehabilitation of your dog. It's important to understand that\n            effective training, behavior modification, and rehabilitation all\n            take time.

All I ask is that\n            you do the same. If you do, chances are very good that you will\n            start seeing small changes almost immediately.
